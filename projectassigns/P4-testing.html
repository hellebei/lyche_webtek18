            <h2>Testing dokument</h2>

                <p>To get both qualitative and quantitative test results we created an user test and a Google Form (link <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPXHvok2iv9QxMprwSdWyGc_8Oa0WeomO-c33EP6MRBWSFZQ/viewform?fbclid=IwAR3eXaAOpT_yfZm5E38rtH1Ke4UwhvqX6HEPahtEg11s4KkYt2EjR_HWp7U" target="_blank">here</a>) to test our web page.
                We wanted to test different aspects of the page's user-friendliness and usability. We sent the Form to friends, fellow students and family with a note saying that the page is aimed at Google Chrome, and recommended them to use this web browser (this is included in the form as well).
                For the live testing we developed a semistructured user test with some warm up-questions, a couple of tasks to understand the users conseptual model of the web page and to test the navigation structure. We then asked them about the general layout and if they had other comments. 
                Here's the document we used for the live testing:</p>

                    <h2>Usability test</h2>

                <p>Have you heard  of the restaurant Lyche before? <br> 
                Have you ever booked a table there? <br><br>
                
                In our course WebTek  are we together with Lyche building a website for Lyche restaurant. Here we have a test of our website.</p>
                
                <h3>Navigation</h3>
                <p> Could you book a table friday 16 o´clock for 5 people? <br>
                You are allergic to nuts, check and see if the desserts on the menu contains nuts. <br>

                <h3>Design:</h3>
                <p> What do you think about the layout? (contrasts, colors, images?, fonts)</p>
                
                <h3>Content:</h3>
                <p>Do you feel that the text is relevant on the different pages? (first page, menu, about us, ect)</p>

            <h2>Tester audience</h2>
            <div class = "br">
                <p>
                    Our web page is primary aimed at students and this is the biggest part of our user group.
                </p>
                <p>From the google form we have these key numbers about who we reached: </p>

        <div class= "topnavpush" id="testplat"></div>
            <h2>Testing platforms</h2>
            <p>
                We wanted to test different platforms to make sure the site is responsive and looked the same across platforms.
                All of the live testings were done using Google Chrome. 
            </p>


        <div class= "topnavpush" id="feedsum"></div>
            <h2>Feedback summary</h2>
            <div class="br">
                <h3>Live testing</h3>
                <p>The live testing is incredibly important because it shows you how people use the page; what features do they get instantly and what do they have to trial and error to understand. 
                    In summary, the testing showed us that the page seems easy to use. The hamburgermenu is frequently used to navigate through the page. We got a lot of positive feedback on the design. ooosossvv
